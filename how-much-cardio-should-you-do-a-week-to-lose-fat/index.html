<p>A 3500-calorie deficit a rough figure is required to lose 045 kg 1lb per week. The idea is to gradually increase it so your body is responsive to it. While cardio does burn calories and helps aid in weight loss combining it with at least two to three days a week of strength training workouts can increase the rate at which you lose weight. You need to work harder than that. The trick here is to either do longer but less intense cardio sessions like 30-45 minutes of high pace walking or 30 minutes of riding a bike at a slower pace 3 to 4 times a week or you can do short 15-20 minute intense interval workouts HIIT tabata or fartlek training 2-3 times a week on non-weightlifting days.

<p>While cardio does burn calories and helps aid in weight loss combining it with at least two to three days a week of strength training workouts can increase the rate at which you lose weight. I believe that you only need 3-4 hard workouts each week to lose belly fat and become fit and lean. Thats why the calorie-burning effects of cardio exercise can be an excellent way to. However weight loss is a complex mechanism thats not entirely understood. Because cardio helps burn calories you can use it as a weight-loss tool to create the calorie deficit you need.
