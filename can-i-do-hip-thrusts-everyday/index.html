<p>The Hip Thrust should be a staple in your program and should be done 1-2 times per week. How many times you perform hip thrusts will depend on your needs and goals. Hip thrusts are especially helpful for runners and spin fanatics. The thing they are best for is booty hypertrophy. Since youre looking at maximal transfer to snatches and jerks I think hip thrusts and American deadlifts could be of value possibly hip thrusts twice per week and American deadlifts once.
