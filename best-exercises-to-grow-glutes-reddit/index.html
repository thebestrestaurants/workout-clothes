<p>Squats are better for general lower body strength. Squats deadlifts hip thrusts lunges paused goblet squats and cable kick backs. Concentrate on primarily using your glute muscles. Both the overload and hypertrophy lower body training days include glute focused exercises. My experience is that heavy lifting best benefits quads and the gluteus maximus but the gluteus minimus tensor fasciae latae and and gluteus medius can be worked best with low-weight exercises like abductions walking lunges donkey kicks fire hydrants clam shells and more abductions.
