<p>Instead try lying on your back with one leg straight and the other leg bent at the knee. If you do have this he offers three. You dont even have to forego working out. DONT DO these if you have low back pain Avoid sitting in one place or one position for a long time. It is a good way to strengthen the lower back muscles and helps relieve pain there too.
