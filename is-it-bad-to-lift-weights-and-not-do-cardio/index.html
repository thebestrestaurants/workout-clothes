<p>The question of whether or not to perform weight training and cardio on the same day has been a long debated issue. If you do steady-state cardio before you lift you wont have the energy to work as hard as you can. Lifting that heavy weight is all about increasing that mass as much as possible hence cardio training is then neglected since it can lead to muscle lossmass loss. Everytime I run after I lift weights I feel like it takes away from the workout. When youre short of time you may not have the luxury of being able to perform weight training and cardio separately.

<p>So for them without cardio training it isnt bad for them. The answer I would give was that cardio burned more calories during the hour you were doing it usually not by a huge margin but weightlifting burned calories while you were doing it and kept on burning calories afterward to feed the muscle you just builtWeight lifting increases your metabolism because you force your body to build more muscle. This 2018 study of endurance athletes showed that mental fatigue impairs your endurance and cognitive abilities. So in that sence you might want to do cardio on off days or far away from your lifting session. If you do steady-state cardio before you lift you wont have the energy to work as hard as you can.
