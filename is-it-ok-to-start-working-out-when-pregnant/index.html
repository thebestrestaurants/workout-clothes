<p>With your doctors okay and by following a few extra precautions you can reap the benefits of exercise during pregnancy no matter what your workout habits were like before conceiving. If you were very active before pregnancy you can keep doing the same workouts with your obstetricians approval. Being pregnant however might present challenges at the workplace. So here I am today a pregnant pre- and post-natal certified personal trainer group fitness instructor and regular gal who wants to calm your fears and clear some things up. If you start an aerobic exercise programme such as running swimming cycling or aerobics classes tell the instructor that youre pregnant and begin with no more than 15 minutes of continuous exercise 3 times a week.
