I think glutes is one of the easier body parts to develop comparing to abdominal line.

<p>Dont Sit So Much. That means waiting for 120 to 144 hours 5 to 6 days between Glute workouts wouldnt make sense if you want them to grow as fast as possible.

Your measure will be plates on the bar or increase of reps and sets- probably best way to keep your sanity and follow short term progress. Dont Sit So Much. However about 4-6 weeks is enough for most people to see changes. If youre going to add weights like a dumbbell to do these routines then you can rest 30-50 seconds in between sets.</p>
