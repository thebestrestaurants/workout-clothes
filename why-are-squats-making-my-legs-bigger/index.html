<p>Here are some of my better tricks and ideas to build a bigger squat. Youll develop more muscle mass and it will show but if youre diet remains bad youre legs run the risk of getting bigger because youll be building muscle underneath the fat which will make them big. Because we see everywhere including social media that people with bigger butt do squats which make us believe that squats is the only exercise that build bigger butt. Everything is tight and seems to ride up no matter how long the legs on the boxer briefs are. I dont use any weights when I do squats I just do them without any equipment.
