<p><strong>How To Squeeze Glutes Without Quads</strong>, Squeeze your glutes hard at the top with your hands resting lightly on the bar. Barbell glute bridges these leave out much of the quad activity that barbell hip thrusts produce. Holding for one minute is a solid time frame to hold a true plank.</p>

<p>Barbell glute bridges these leave out much of the quad activity that barbell hip thrusts produce. I would never tell someone to squeeze their glutes at the top of a squat. This requires a lot of work from the quads but during this phase glute contraction would prevent the hips from flexing.</p>
<h3 id="as-for-glute-hip-thrusts-make-sure-you-are-really-squeezing-your-butt-and-forcing-your-hip-to-go-slightly-past-parallel-to-the-floor">As for glute hip thrusts make sure you are really squeezing your butt and forcing your hip to go slightly past parallel to the floor.</h3><p>Keep your core braced. During the straightening phase hip flexion brings the torso upright again. Use a resistance band to make this more challenging. Then lift up while keeping your glutes contracted. And without arching your lower back squeeze your butt muscles to get them engaged first.</p>
