<p>Fake hustle reps lead to a fake hustle body. Knowing the function of the glutes will help us understand how they can be recruited through either hip thrusts or squats. I suggest 36 sets of 512 reps 34 times a week with the heaviest weight you can manage.

You can do them with a Smith machine or Olympic barbell a bench and a bar pad. Hip Thrusts 18 Benefits Form Tips Variations Weights And More.</p>
