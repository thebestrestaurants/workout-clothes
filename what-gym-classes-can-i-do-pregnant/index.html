<p>The cult-favorite fitness app has recently launched a series of prenatal classes led by Arzón. If you start to feel nauseated or lightheaded slowly stop the exercise and relax. I told my class instructors and carried on doing combat and spinfit until I was 7 mths pregnant in my last 2 pregnancies and found it really staved off the ante-natal depression I experienced in my first pregnancy when I stopped all exercise. Listen to your bodyyou know it better than anyone else. Do 2 sets of 15 to 20 reps. Pin On Baby.</p>
