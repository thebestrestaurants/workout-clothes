<p>Lift your pelvis off the ground while supporting on your feet and shoulders. Drop your glutes straight down and bend your knees to take an overhand or alternating grip on the bar. If your hips are stubborn or if youre trying to build a physique with disproportionately big glutes it can help to include lifts that only train your glutes. Squeeze your glutes to lift your hips up until your body forms a straight line from neck to knee. The best butt workout will not only build a stronger rounder butt but also protect your lower back and knees from injuries. Pin On Glute Workouts.</p>
