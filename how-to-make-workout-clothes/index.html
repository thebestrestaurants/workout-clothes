<p>If possible let sweaty clothes air out immediately rather than stuffing them into a plastic bag or hamper. No matter whether you lay out workout clothes the night before a run or grab something before a workout having all of the fitness clothes in one place makes it easier. Be mindful of where your target market is locatedintroduce light-reflective running attire for northerners or sweat-proof tank tops for southerners. Make sure that your custom activewear works with you not against you. Most workout clothes come in black or gray.
