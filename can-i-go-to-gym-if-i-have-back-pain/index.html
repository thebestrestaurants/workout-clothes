<p>Chartered Physiotherapist Minhal Bandali advises whether or not to continue going to the gym if you have back pain in this short video. Upright exercises like jogging running and cycling can often cause unwanted strain and stress on your back especially if you have back pain. As the bar is balanced on the back of the shoulders it can be a dangerous exercise for lower back hips knees even when done with perfection. It is important to start slowly and to gradually build up the speed and length of time that you do the exercise. You can even bring the gym to your home which makes getting to the gym a nonissue.
