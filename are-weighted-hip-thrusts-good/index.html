<p>Some people may feel better muscle contraction with the glute bridge and some people may find that the hip thrust provides better muscle contraction which can drive their preference over which exercise they use but thats not to say they cant both be incorporated. In my relatively amateur opinion once you can do weighted hip thrusts or weighted anything for that matter doing bodyweight stuff for the sake of building muscle becomes kind of redundant. The glute bridge is a good exercise for those without equipment but if you have access to a bench and a barbell plus some weights to throw on the ends the hip thrust is a better exercise for building strength speed and power. Some people may feel better muscle contraction with the glute bridge and some people may find that the hip thrust provides better muscle contraction which can drive their preference over which exercise they use but thats not to say they cant both be incorporated. Although squats and deadlifts are considered to be the best butt exercises the centre of the body back and thigh muscles are also engaged when performing them.

<p>Hip thrusts build strength and size in your glutes in a way many other exercises cannot and experts agree that they provide benefits for many people from athletes to. By exaggerating the hip thrust through a heavily weighted barbell we have been able to expose issues within the lift. Our hip thrust standards are based on 188000 lifts by Strength Level users. Its a great movement because it hits two of the largest muscles in your body incorporates explosive movement and allows you to really overload your muscles. In my relatively amateur opinion once you can do weighted hip thrusts or weighted anything for that matter doing bodyweight stuff for the sake of building muscle becomes kind of redundant. 3 Excellent Glute Building Workouts 1 Weighted Cable Kickbacks 4x15 2 Cable Pull Throughs Hip Thrusts Sq Fit Girl Motivation Glutes Workout At Home Workouts.</p>
