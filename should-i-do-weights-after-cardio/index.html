<p>The reason being is that weight lifting doesnt deplete your glycogen stores as bad as it does in cardio workouts depending on how intense you go. After Weights Cardio after training is beneficial because it cools you down and helps you loosen up after the intense session. Should I do cardio or cardio weights. You can do 40 minutes of weight training followed by 20 minutes of cardio with your energy levels remaining relatively strong. This is why if your main goal isnt to get better at cardio it should be left for after weights or done on another day that wont impact your energy to get through your weight training workout.

<p>The majority of fitness experts will advise you to do the cardio after the weight training because if you do cardio first it uses up much of the energy source for your anaerobic work strength training and fatigues the muscles before their most strenuous activity. If youre trying to lose weight then youll want to burn extra calories so lean towards 20-30 minutes of cardio after weight lifting. Knocking out your cardio after you crush the weights will burn more fat. When you weight-train you typically use glycogen as fuel. If your goal is to get stronger and build or maintain your muscle mass then youll want to avoid doing your cardio before you lift weights as it can decrease performance and increase your risk of injury.
