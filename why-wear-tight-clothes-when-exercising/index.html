<p>If your clothes are too tight then this can become a problem and cause issues during and after exercise. A general misconception is to wear more clothes to allow the body to sweat extra and lose more weight. Working out is a good time to relax and wearing comfortable clothing can make exercising more enjoyable. It isnt best to wear loose fitting clothing when exercising as you may not feel too comfortable. From a purely functional view it appears that tight workout clothes are actually better at their job.
