I also noticed a significant difference in the texture of the fabric. Hopefully now you understand why is Lululemon so expensive. Lululemons 98 pair looks almost exactly like Athletas 79 pants. Lululemon Athletica charges about 20 more for a pair of basic yoga pants than Gap Incs Athleta simply because it knows women will pay for the brand. Pin On Wish List.</p>

<p>Lululemon is not an exception to these factors. Since then its market value has shrunk from 10 billion to 6 billion. Lululemon creates its own proprietary fabrics. It is to price the products depending on the work and resources that go into making the product. Heres how Lululemon created such a powerful cult-like image and following.

<p>Lululemon suffered a huge blow in March of last year when it had to recall 17 of its pants for being too sheer. Lululemon Athletica charges about 20 more for a pair of basic yoga pants than Gap Incs Athleta simply because it knows women will pay for the brand. My theory on why they received so much bad publicity is because people expect higher quality standards for Lululemon items than they do for cheaper items. For example combed cotton is a much higher quality material and also much more expensive to produce and therefore bought by companies like Lululemon that sell higher quality clothing. Since then its market value has shrunk from 10 billion to 6 billion.
