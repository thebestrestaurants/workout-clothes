Sautter recommends doing LISS around five days a week for at least 45 minutes to get the maximum benefits. One must be able to maintain this heart rate. He was saying that the best type of cardio workout was to stay in zone one meaning about 110-130 BPM assuming your max HR is about 170-180 for roughly two hours 4-5 days a week and about 10 minutes of high intensity cardio at about 160 BPM once a week. An hour to burn it slow. Cardio Intensity Low Moderate Or High Eat More 2 Weigh Less Low Intensity Cardio Cardio Moderation.</p>

<p>At least 45 minutes. References Williams LD and AR Morton 1986 Changes in selected cardiorespiratory responses to exercise and in body composition following a 12-week aerobic dance programme. Yet as commonplace as LSD exercise may be it nevertheless fell prey to the misconception that a good workout could not be a painless. May I ask how many times per week we should do the low intensity cardio 120-150bpm for 30 to 90 min to cause the desirable left ventricle size adaptation. It will depend on the intensity and duration of your training as well as whether youll be working out again later on in the day. .</p>

<p>Walking is not very labor-intensive which is the entire idea. Its the bread-and-butter of any running program. Intensity training will also boost your metabolism long after the workout is done. At least 45 minutes. However LISS can be done almost daily and can be performed for long durations to build aerobic endurance. Pin On Build Muscle Burn Fat.</p>
