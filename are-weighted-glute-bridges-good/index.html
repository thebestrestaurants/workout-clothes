<p>I dont know how much they differ from thrusts when it comes to what muscles are being worked and how much but you they definitely dont have to be a bodyweight only exercise. The key to bodyweight glute bridges is to actually learn to engage your glutes in the exercise. Bring the plate up and on to your pelvic area. Essentially a glute bridge is a floor exercise and it can be done with or without weights. All you need to perform the exercise is a mat and a barbell or other weight.
