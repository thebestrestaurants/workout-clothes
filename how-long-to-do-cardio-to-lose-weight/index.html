<p>What To Eat After Fasted Cardio Now as for what to eat after your fasted cardio workout. Sometimes weight loss rather than heart health is the main goal of cardiovascular exercise. The current theory is 300 minutes a week. That is the average time it takes for the body to use up your sugar reserves and start burning fat. You will do cardio for as long as it takes.

<p>Id answer the first question like that. The sweet spot for losing weight is between one and two hours of cardio per week. How long should you do cardio to lose weight. However that is also assuming youre not lifting weights or performing any other form of exercise. If that is your goal be sure to exercise for at least 15 minutes. Pin On Visual Fitness.</p>
