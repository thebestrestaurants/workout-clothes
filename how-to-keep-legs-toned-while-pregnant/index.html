Try to raise your legs 6 to 12 inches above your heart for 15 to 20 minutes to help the blood flow back to your heart and lungs. Avoid situps and crunches throughout your pregnancy. Keep on going with your diet and nutrition strategy and keep on building strength and muscle in the gym and youll be well on your way.
