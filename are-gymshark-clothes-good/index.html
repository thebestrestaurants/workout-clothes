<p>But first and foremost they bring clothing not equipment so there is probably better quality materials elsewhere. On top of ordering gymshark apparel I also ordered and bought workout apparel from over 10 other companies. Gymshark is an online fitness apparel brand based in the UK. It is breathable moisture-wicking stretchy resistant to odor mold and mildew and extremely durable. Overall Id say Gymshark isnt bad but its become somewhat overrated and I like Lululemon more.
