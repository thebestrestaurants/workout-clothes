<p>I dont have to do any cardio to drop body fat but some people must hit the cardio hard to get rid of that last layer of fat. There is no single best workout to get ripped in 30 days but it requires a different combination of workouts which works your overall body muscles. You can in general be muscular without working out but you will probably retain more fat along with the muscle you gain. If it isnt effective at all than your muscles grow very large.

Also weather you are muscular or not without doing any exercises whatsoever is highly dependent on your diet. Work out your muscles. Pin On Exercise.</p>
