<p>If your goal is to build more muscular legs then you should absolutely add some hill runs to your fitness regimen as this activity is a tremendous leg workout that will seriously tax your quads calves glutes and hamstrings. However running per se will not make your butt. But at the end of the day it will still build muscle in your legs. When you run uphill you involve your gluteal muscles at a greater range as your thigh rises higher and at a wider angle than during the usual horizontal running. Running uphill provides a highly effective workout and can definitely help you achieve a number of fitness goals. Pin On Bigger Butt Workouts.</p>
