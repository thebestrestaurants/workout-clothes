<p>An oly lift plan would go like this - tonight will be a 21 CJ max 7-10 sets depending on how many times i try my top set then 3 downsets 13 sets total 1 minute of lifting 2-3 minutes of rest so 134 52 minutes. Your 8RM Is the Moneymaker. So say Im doing skull crushers. Stand on the edge of a step with your feet parallel to each other. Weightlifting should not be done more than every other day allowing at least one full day of rest between sessions and many trainers recommend a three-day-a-week schedule.
