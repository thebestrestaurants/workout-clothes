<p>My butt got smaller from doing stronglifts 5x5 while eating at a surplus which involves heavy barbell squats 3x a week. On the contrary lunges if done in high volumes can actually increase the size of the thighs. The long answer is going to take me. Ive done squats for years and it just keeps the tone for me. Kenneth Hughes MD Los Angeles CA. Pin On Sportief.</p>
