<p>Because your workouts will be high volume you will need to allow your muscles 72 hours of rest in between sessions. As you do the waves you stretch arm muscles. But a good rule of thumb when trying to build or maintain muscle is to match your weight in pounds to your protein intake in grams. Then raise your arms further up and rotate them backwards in a 360-degree motion like a windmill. Because were using light weights were focusing on tightening muscle not building mass and strength.
