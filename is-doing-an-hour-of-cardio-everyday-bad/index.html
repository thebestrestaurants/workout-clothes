<h3 id="and-why-it-can-be-both-good-and-bad-to-do-cardio-every-day">And why it can be both good and bad to do cardio every day.</h3><p>Ive been doing well over an hour of cardio per day for a long time. Every day then that will start to have negative consequences over time. If you have to do an hour or more of cardio per day just to burn off the extra calories you consumed the answer is to look at your diet.

Of course if youre in pain or need time to recover then its not a bad idea to take a day off.</p>

<p>I am trying to lose fat with a strict diet Xenadrine flax oil and cardio on an empty stomach every morning. An hour of cardio every day may also be in order for certain kinds of competitive athletes and people who due to injury must substantially curtail their strength training. If you are working out and you feel pain or like you are going to vomit you need to stop. Among the most important factors of how many days a week you workout depends on how long each session goes and at what intensity you exercise. Everybody is different in terms of their tolerance to exercise but doing more than an hour of cardiovascular activity everyday may be excessive. Pin On Working Out At Home.</p>
